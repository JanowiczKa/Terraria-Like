# Terraria-Like
This was a project for my Java coursework 1st year in university, the goals for this implementation was to use Java to
create a game similar to Terraria, at least in the basic sense. The game uses chunks for optimisation, and on default
creates a world with over 40,000 tiles in one world, without impacting performance.

Features:
- Create a randomly generated world
- Optimise the game so that the size of the world does not influence the performance
- Let the user edit the world by destroying and placing tiles

To play the game, you must run the "Main" class
